# Pandemic_Simulation
This project is a pandemic model I created for Honors in ECE 220.  It takes in the number of people in a population, and the age demographic. It randomly generates households and workplaces in groups for random people based on their generated age. These generated households hold combinations of people that are somewhat realistic (some households have parents and their children in the same household). There are also workplace and social groups that are randomly generated at the beginning of the program. There are given prompts that have options to change the regulations and testing frequency of the population. The initial rate of infection is a number that can be changed at the beginning of the program. The goal with this project was to see how changing regulations and testing frequency affects the spread of a disease. In a future update I will add more event functions as well as a side program that runs many simulations and summarizes the data found in all scenarios as the model's results are different every time. On the word document there is a detailed description of all the functions within the project and some sample data that I graphed.
